        <p class="rail s1 left">Above all else, I am a scientist. In everything I do,
          I bring an analytic point of view, and strive for test-based solutions
           to all problems. I am a cloud-enthusiast, technologist, and curious
          academic.
        </p>
        <p class="rail s2 left">I graduated from the University of Richmond in 2015
          with a B.S. in chemistry, after which I went to work for Capital One
          Bank as a software engineer. In my time as an undergrad, I was a
          member of the Parish lab group and worked in computational quantum
          chemistry, making/calculating mathematical models of di-radical
          molecules resulting from the combustion of asphaltenes (found in
          petroleum products).  The power and utility of programming became
          apparent to me while working in this group, and led me to teach myself
          a fair amount of computer science. After graduating, I was fortunate
          enough to be able to transition into a software engineering position
          at Capital One through the Technology Development Program.
        </p>
        <p class="rail s2 left">In my free time, I enjoy working on pet projects
          (such as this website), reading about the latest advances in
          technology and sciences, cooking, investing, and playing sports.
